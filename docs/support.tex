The translator makes use of several utilities all of which 
are freely available on most platforms. 

You can choose between two ways to do the installation of the required
tools: either go the convenient way and install binary distributions
(no compilation required, just install out of the box), or get and
compile a source code distribution.
You will stick to the latter in case you have a special kind of
operating system or want to make customisations prior to compilation
such as applying source level patches.
Windows users will probably want to read the section about
\htmlref{installation on Windows}{windowsinst}.

For the best use of \latextohtml{} you want to get the latest
versions of all the utilities that it uses. (It will still work
with earlier versions, but some  special effects may not be possible. 
The specific requirements are discussed below.)
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \Perl{} version 5.003, or later (check with \verb/perl -v/);
\item \LaTeX, meaning \LaTeXe{} dated \texttt{<1995/06/01>}, or later;
\item \fn{dvips} or \fn{dvipsk}, at version 5.58 or later;
\item \appl{Ghostscript} at version 4.02 or later;
\item \fn{netpbm} library of graphics utilities, version \textsc{1-mar-94}\\
  (check with \fn{pnmcrop} \Cs{version}).
\item \texttt{pdftocairo}, if you want to produce SVG images
      (available through the poppler-utils package)
\end{itemize}

\medskip\htmlrule
\medskip\noindent
More specific requirements for using \latextohtml{} 
depend on the kind of translation you would like to perform, as follows:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\index{requirements!minimal}%
\textbf{\LaTeX{}  commands but without equations, figures, tables, etc.} \hfill
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\htmladdnormallink{Perl}{http://www.perl.com/}
\begin{small}
\textbf{Note:} \latextohtml{}\textbf{ requires \Perl{ 5} to operate}.
\end{small}\html{\smallskip}


\index{requirements!DataBase Management system}%
\item 
\appl{DBM} or \appl{NDBM}, the Unix DataBase Management system,
or \appl{GDBM}, the GNU database manager.

\textbf{Note: }Some systems lack any DBM support.
\Perl{ 5} comes with its own database system SDBM, but it is sometimes
not part of some Perl distributions.

The installation script \fn{install-test} will check that for you.
If no database system is found, you will have to install Perl
properly.
\end{itemize}

\index{requirements!for full graphics}%
\index{tables!as images}\index{images!tables}%
\index{images!figures}\index{images!equations}%
\item 
\textbf{\LaTeX{}  commands with equations, figures, tables, etc.} \\
As above plus \dots
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \fn{latex} (version 2e recommended but 2.09 will work --- with
reduced ability to support styles and packages);
%
\index{dvips@\texttt{dvips} version}
\item 
\htmladdnormallink{\fn{dvips}}
{ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/pub/archive/dviware/dvips}
(version~5.516 or later) or \fn{dvipsk}\\
  Version 5.62 or higher enhances the performance of image creation
  with a \emph{significant} speed-up. See latex2html.config for this
  after you are done with the installation.
  Do not use the 'dvips -E' feature unless you have 5.62, else you
  will get broken images.
%
\index{Ghostscript@\textsl{Ghostscript} version}
\item 
\fn{gs} \appl{Ghostscript} (version 4.03 or later);
  with the ppmraw device driver, or even better pnmraw.
  Upgrade to 5.10 or later if you want to go sure about seldom problems
  with 4.03 to avoid (yet unclarified).
%
\index{image conversion!Postscript@\PS\ to GIF}%
\index{GIF!image conversion}%
\item 
The \htmladdnormallink{\fn{netpbm}}{ftp://ftp.x.org/R5contrib/}
library of graphics utilities; \fn{netpbm} dated 1 March 1994
is required, else part of the image creation process will fail.\\
Check with: \fn{pnmcrop} \Cs{version}.

Several of the filters in those libraries are used during the \PS\ to
GIF conversion. 
\index{image conversion!Postscript@\PS\ to PNG}%
\index{PNG!image conversion}%
\item 
If you want PNG images, you need \fn{pnmtopng} (current version is 2.31).
It is not part of \fn{netpbm} and requires \fn{libpng-0.89c.tar.gz} and
\fn{libz} (1.0.4) (or later versions).
\fn{pnmtopng} supports transparency and interlace mode.
\end{itemize}


\index{requirements!for segmentation feature}%
\index{segmentation!needs latex2e@needs \LaTeXe}%
\item 
\textbf{\htmlref{Segmentation}{Segmentation} of large documents}\\
If you wish to use this feature, you will have to upgrade your
\LaTeX{} to \LaTeXe\,. 
Some other hyperlinking features also require \LaTeXe\,.

\index{requirements!for transparent images}%
\index{images!transparent}%
\item 
\textbf{Transparent inlined images}\\
If you dislike the white background color of the
generated inlined images then you should get either 
the \fn{netpbm} library (instead of the older \fn{pbmplus}) 
or install the \fn{giftrans}
%{ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/comm/infosystems/www/tools/imaging/giftrans/giftrans-1.11.1.tar.gz}
filter by Andreas Ley \Email{ley@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de}. 
\latextohtml{} now supports the shareware program \fn{giftool}
(by Home Pages, Inc., version 1.0), too.
It can also create interlaced GIFs.
%
\end{enumerate} 

\index{requirements!without images}%

\noindent
If \appl{Ghostscript} or the \fn{netpbm} library are
not available, it is still possible to use the translator with the
\Cs{no\_images} option. 

\index{requirements!for special features}\index{special!features}%
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file!needed for special features}%
\html{\\}%

If you intend to use any of the \htmlref{special features}{sec:hyp}
of the translator \latex{(see page~\pageref{sec:hyp})}
then you have to include the \fn{html.sty} file 
in any \LaTeX{}  documents that use them. 

\index{browser!character-based}%
\index{browser!character-based}\index{browser!lynx@\textsl{lynx}}%
\html{\\}%

If only a character-based browser, such as \appl{lynx}, is available, 
or if you want the generated documents to be more portable, 
then the translator can be used with the \Cs{ascii\_mode} 
\hyperref{option}{option (see Section~}{)}{cs_asciimode}.

\subsection{Installation on Windows}
\label{windowsinst}\index{installation!on~Windows~95/98/NT}
To install the tools required to run the translator, perform the steps
below. Thanks to Jens Berger (\texttt{jberger@mail.zedat.fu-berlin.de})
for providing this list!
\begin{itemize}
\item install {WinZip};
\item install \TeX/\LaTeXe{} and \fn{dvips};
\item install \Perl{};\\
   E.g.\ {ActivePerl} from \ActiveStateURL.
\item install \appl{Ghostscript};
\item install the \fn{netpbm} tools library from \NetpbmWinURL.
\item unpack \latextohtml{}, e.g.\ under \verb|C:\TEXMF\LATEX2HTML|;
\item check that the path to \texttt{GSWIN32C.EXE} is added to the
  \texttt{PATH} variable in your \texttt{AUTOEXEC.BAT};
\item with \latextohtml{} $99.1$ or higher, edit \texttt{l2hconf.pin},
  then run \texttt{CONFIG.BAT} to install the translator;\\
  with older releases, edit \texttt{LATEX2HTML.CONFIG} and run
  \begin{verbatim}
  cd c:\texmf\latex2html
  perl install-test
  \end{verbatim}
  from within a DOS box.
\item you might want to write a small \texttt{.BAT} file in your
  \latextohtml{} directory:
  \begin{verbatim}
  perl c:\texmf\latex2html\latex2html %1 %2 %3 >> l2h.log
  \end{verbatim}
  \texttt{\%1} is the name of the \texttt{.TEX} file,
  \texttt{\%2} and \texttt{\%3} are optional arguments to the
  translator such as \Cs{"-split 3"}.\\
  Note that if you want more than two arguments you will need
  to supply more parameters to the \texttt{.BAT} file.
\item run it with a test document \texttt{test.tex}:
  \begin{verbatim}
   l2h test
  \end{verbatim}
  Maybe you will need to run \LaTeX{} before this, too!
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installing \protect\latextohtml}%
%\section{Installing \protect\latextohtml}%
\index{installation!latex2html}\html{\\}%
To install \latextohtml{} you \textbf{MUST} do the following:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\textbf{Specify where \Perl{} is on your system}. \\
In each of the files \fn{latex2html}, \fn{texexpand}, \fn{pstoimg},
\fn{install-test} and \fn{makemap},
modify the first line saying where \Perl{} is on your system.

\index{installation!without Perl@without \Perl{} shell scripts}

\noindent
Some system administrators do not allow \Perl{} programs to run as shell scripts. 
This means that you may not be able to run any of the above programs. 
\emph{In this case change the first line in each of these programs from }
\html{\smallskip}
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\verb|#!/usr/local/bin/perl | 
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}
\html{\smallskip}\emph{to}:
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\begin{verbatim}
# *-*-perl-*-*
    eval 'exec perl -S  $0 "$@"'
    if $running_under_some_shell; 
\end{verbatim}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}

\index{installation!system installation}%
\index{installation!LaTeX packages}%
\item
Copy the files to the destination directory.\\
Copy the contents of the \fn{texinputs/} directory to a place where they
will be found by \LaTeX, or set up your \fn{TEXINPUTS} variable to point
to that directory.

\index{installation!check path-names}%
\index{installation!graphics utilities}%
\item 
\textbf{Run \fn{install-test}\,.} \\
This \Perl{} script will make some changes in the \fn{latex2html} file
and then check whether the path-names to any external utilities
required by \fn{latex2html} are correct.
It will not actually install the external utilities. 
\fn{install-test} asks you whether to configure for GIF or
\fn{PNG} image generation.
Finally it creates the file \fn{local.pm} which houses pathnames for the
external utilities determined earlier.

\smallskip\noindent
You might need to make \fn{install-test} executable before using it.\\
Use \verb/chmod +x install-test/ to do this.

\smallskip\noindent
You may also need to make the files \fn{pstogif}, 
\fn{texexpand}, \fn{configure-pstoimg} and \fn{latex2html} executable 
if \fn{install-test} fails to do it for you.

\index{installation!system installation}%
\item
If you like so, copy or move the \fn{latex2html} executable script to
some location outside the \fn{\$LATEX2HTMLDIR} directory.

\index{installation!change configuration}%
\index{installation!change defaults}
\item 
You might want to edit \fn{latex2html.config} to reflect your needs.
Read the instructions about \fn{\$ICONSERVER} carefully to make sure your
\fn{HTML} documents will be displayed right via the Web server.\\
While you're at it you may want to change some of the default
options in this file.\\
If you do a system installation for many users, only cope with general
aspects; let the user override these with \verb|$HOME/.latex2html-init|.
%
\end{enumerate}


Note that you \emph{must} run \fn{install-test} now;
formerly you could manage without.
If you want to reconfigure \latextohtml{} for GIF/PNG image
generation, or because some of the external tools changed the location,
simply rerun \fn{configure-pstoimg}.


\medskip\htmlrule[50\% center]
\noindent
This is usually enough for the main installation, but you may also 
want to do some of the following, to ensure that advanced features 
of \latextohtml{} work correctly on your system:
\begin{itemize}
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file!location}%
\index{installation!environment variable}%
\item 
\textbf{To use the new \LaTeX{}  commands 
which are defined in \fn{html.sty}:}\\
Make sure that \LaTeX{}  knows where the \fn{html.sty} file is, 
either by putting it in the same place as the other style-files on your system, 
or by changing your \fn{TEXINPUTS} shell environment variable,
or by copying \fn{html.sty} into the same directory as your \LaTeX{}  source file.

The environment variable \fn{TEXINPUTS} is not to be confused with 
the \latextohtml{} installation variable \fn{\$TEXINPUTS} described next.
\par

\index{installation!input-path variable}%
\item
There is an installation variable in \fn{latex2html.config}
called \fn{\$TEXINPUTS}, 
which tells \latextohtml{} where to look for \LaTeX{} style-files to process.  
It can also affect the input-path of \LaTeX{} when called by \latextohtml,
unless the command \fn{latex} is really a script 
which overwrites the \fn{\$TEXINPUTS} variable 
prior to calling the real \fn{latex}.
This variable is overridden by the environment variable of the same name 
if it is set.

\index{installation!fonts-path variable}%
\item
The installation variable \fn{\$PK\_GENERATION} specifies which
fonts are used in the generation of mathematical equations.  A value
of ``\texttt{0}'' causes the same fonts to be used as those for the default
printer.  Because they were designed for a printer of much greater
resolution than the screen, equations will generally appear to be
of a lower quality than is otherwise possible.  To cause \latextohtml{} to
dynamically generate fonts that are designed specifically for the
screen, you should specify a value of ``\texttt{1}'' for this variable.
If you do, then check to see whether your version of \texttt{dvips}
supports the command-line option \Cs{mode}\,.  If it does,
then also set the installation variable \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} to
a low resolution entry from \fn{modes.mf}, such as \fn{toshiba}.

It may also be necessary to edit the \fn{MakeTeXPK} script, 
to recognise this mode at the appropriate resolution.

If you have \PS\ fonts available for use with \LaTeX{} and \fn{dvips}
then you can probably ignore the above complications and simply
set \fn{\$PK\_GENERATION} to ``\texttt{0}'' 
and \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} to \texttt{\char34\char34} (the empty string).
You must also make sure that \fn{gs} has the locations of the
fonts recorded in its \fn{gs\_fonts.ps} file. This should already be the case
where \appl{GS-Preview} is installed as the viewer for \texttt{.dvi}-files,
using the \PS\ fonts.

If \fn{dvips} does \emph{not} support the \Cs{mode} switch,
then leave \fn{\$DVIPS\_MODE} undefined, and verify that the
\fn{.dvipsrc} file points to the correct screen device and its
resolution.

\index{installation!filename-prefix}\label{autoprefix}%
\item
The installation variable \fn{\$AUTO\_PREFIX} 
allows the filename-prefix to be automatically set 
to the base filename-prefix of the document being translated.  
This can be especially useful for multiple-segment documents.

%%JCL obsolete with Perl5
%%\index{installation!Linux@\textsl{Linux} systems}%
%%\item 
%%On certain \appl{Linux} systems it is necessary to uncomment
%%the line ``\texttt{use GDBM\_File}'' in the \fn{latex2html}
%%and \fn{install-test} scripts, to define the interface to the
%%data\-base-management routines.

\index{installation!makemap script@\texttt{makemap} script}%
\index{CERN!image-map server}\index{NCSA!image-map server}%
\item 
The \fn{makemap} script also has a configuration variable \fn{\$SERVER}, 
which must be set to either \texttt{CERN} or \texttt{NCSA}, 
depending on the type of Web-server you are using.


\index{installation!initialization files}%
\index{initialization file!per user}%
\label{initfile}%
\item \textbf{To set up different initialization files:}\\
For a ``per user'' initialization file, 
copy the file \fn{dot.latex2html-init} in the home directory
of any user that wants it, modify it according to her preferences and
rename it as \ \fn{.latex2html-init}. At runtime, both the 
\fn{latex2html.config} file and \fn{\$HOME/.latex2html-init} file will be
loaded, but the latter will take precedence.

\index{initialization file!per directory}%

You can also set up a ``per directory'' initialization file by 
copying a version of \ \fn{.latex2html-init} in each directory you
would like it to be effective. An initialization file
\path{/X/Y/Z/.latex2html-init} will take precedence over all other
initialization files if \path{/X/Y/Z} is the ``current directory'' when
\latextohtml{} is invoked.

\index{initialization file!incompatible with early versions}% 
\begin{quotation}\noindent 
\textbf{Warning: }%
This initialization file is incompatible with
any version of \latextohtml\ prior to \textsc{v96.1}\,.  
Users must either update this file in their home directory, 
or delete it altogether.
\end{quotation}

\index{installation!icons subdirectory@\texttt{icons/} subdirectory}%
\item \label{icondir}%
\textbf{To make your own local copies of the \latextohtml{} icons:} \\
Please copy the \fn{icons/} subdirectory to a 
place under your WWW tree
where they can be served by your server.
Then modify the value of the \fn{\$ICONSERVER} variable in 
\fn{latex2html.config} accordingly.
\index{installation!local icons}%
Alternatively, a local copy of the icons can be included within
the subdirectory containing your completed \texttt{HTML} documents.
This is most easily done using the \Cs{local\_icons} command-line switch,
or by setting \fn{\$LOCAL\_ICONS} to ``\texttt{1}'' in \fn{latex2html.config}
or within an initialization file, as described \htmlref{above}{initfile}.

\index{installation!create manual}%
\index{documentation!test of installation}%
\item
\textbf{To make your own local copy of the \latextohtml{}
documentation:} \\
This will also be a good test of your installation. 
% To do it run \latextohtml{} on the file \fn{docs/manual.tex}.
% You will get better results if you run \LaTeX{} first on the 
% same file in order to create some auxiliary files.
%
\index{documentation!dvi version@\texttt{.dvi} version}%
\noindent
Firstly, to obtain the \texttt{.dvi} version for printing,
from within the \fn{docs/} directory it is sufficient to type:

%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\texttt{ make manual.dvi}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}

\noindent
This initiates the following sequence of commands:
%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\begin{verbatim}
latex manual.tex
makeindex -s l2hidx.ist manual.idx
makeindex -s l2hglo.ist -o manual.gls manual.glo
latex manual.tex
latex manual.tex
\end{verbatim}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}
\index{documentation!using makeindex@using \texttt{makeindex}}%
\index{documentation!index and glossary}%
...in which the two configuration files \fn{l2hidx.ist} and \fn{l2hglo.ist} 
for the \fn{makeindex} program, are used to create the index and glossary respectively.
The 2nd run of \fn{latex} is needed to assimilate references, etc.
and include the index and glossary.\html{\\}%
\index{documentation!without makeindex@without \texttt{makeindex}}%
\html{\\}
(In case \fn{makeindex} is not available, a copy of its outputs \fn{manual.ind} 
and \fn{manual.gls} are included in the \fn{docs/} subdirectory, 
along with \fn{manual.aux}\,.)\html{\\}
The 3rd run of \fn{latex} is needed to adjust page-numbering for the Index 
and Glossary within the Table-of-Contents.

\noindent
Next, the \texttt{HTML} version is obtained by typing:

%begin{latexonly}
\begin{small}
%end{latexonly}
\texttt{make manual.html}
%begin{latexonly}
\end{small}
%end{latexonly}

\noindent
This initiates a series of calls to \latextohtml{} on the separate
segments of the manual; 
the full manual is thus created as a ``segmented document''
(see \hyperref{a later section}{Section~}{}{Segmentation}).
The whole process may take quite some time, 
as each segment needs to be processed at least twice, 
to collect the cross-references from other segments.

\medskip
\index{documentation!requirements}\html{\\}%
\noindent
The files necessary for correct typesetting of the manual to be
found within the \fn{docs/} subdirectory. 
They are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
%
\index{html.sty@\texttt{html.sty} style-file}%
\index{documentation!style-files}%
\item
style-files:
 \fn{l2hman.sty}, \fn{html.sty}, \fn{htmllist.sty}, \fn{justify.sty},\\
  \fn{changebar.sty} and \fn{url.sty}
%
\index{documentation!input files}%
\item
inputs:
 \strikeout{\fn{changes.tex},} \fn{credits.tex}, \fn{features.tex}, \fn{hypextra.tex},\\
 \fn{licence.tex}, \fn{manhtml.tex}, \fn{manual.tex}, \fn{overview.tex},\\
 \fn{problems.tex}, \fn{support.tex} and \fn{userman.tex}
%
\index{documentation!graphics}%
\item
sub-directory:
 \fn{psfiles/} containing \PS\ graphics
 used in the printed version of this manual
%
\index{documentation!images}%
\item
images of small curved arrows: \fn{up.gif}, \fn{dn.gif}
%
\index{documentation!filename data}%
\item
filename data:
 \fn{l2hfiles.dat}
%
\index{documentation!auxiliaries}%
\item
auxiliaries:
 \fn{manual.aux}, \fn{manual.ind}, \fn{manual.gls}
%
\end{itemize}

The last three can be derived from the others, but are included for convenience.
\par

\index{documentation!Changes section}%
\item 

\textbf{To get a printed version of the `Changes' section: }\\
Due to the burgeoning size of the \fn{Changes} file with successive
revisions of \latextohtml, the `Changes' section is no longer
supported for the manual.
Please refer to text file \fn{Changes} instead which is part of the
distribution.
